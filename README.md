# image_galary_website
A simple and responsive image gallery with a lightbox effect, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project displays a grid of images, and when you click on an image, a modal lightbox opens to show the enlarged version. Users can navigate between images using next and previous buttons.
